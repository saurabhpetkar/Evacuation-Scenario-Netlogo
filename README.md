# Evacuation-Scenario-Netlogo
We want to simulate the emergency evacuation scenario particularly in a terrorist attack scenario with inclusion of detailed modelling of hostage movement such as different levels of exit awareness, and simulating stampede mechanism and various terrorist attack strategies to observe survival rate and deaths by terrorist kills as well as natural deaths by stampedes and how it will be different when Rescue management is present and grouping and remote grouping,help signs is implemented


Adjust the slider parameters (see below), or use the default settings.
To setup the terrorist attack strategy use the “setup-choices” dropdown to choose : 1. Random 2. Near Exit 3. Centre
Press the SETUP button. Press the GO button to begin the simulation.
